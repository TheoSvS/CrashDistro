A program that monitors the CrashOut game on Solana in order to extract some valuable statistics to increase bet gains and win rate. 

It monitors the historical data of the past games and provides insight on best betting strategies at any given time, since the game results of this game don't seem to be entirely and properly randomized.. 

In example, with a starting bet of $50 the portfolio value has reached $2000 in around 10-12 days of consistent strategical betting.

I will not provide my betting strategy. The user is supposed to add his own betting conditions in Bettooor class, based on his observations and strategy.

The application needs the funding wallet's private key in order to sign the betting and claiming transactions. You should edit the solcrash.properties file at the project root directory and add to the property "secret = " the private key of the wallet.
