# CrashDistro
A program that monitors the CrashOut game on Solana in order to extract some valuable statistics to increase bet gains and win rate.
It monitors the historical data of the past games and provides insight on best betting strategies at any given time, since the game results of this game don't seem to be entirely and properly randomized.. In example, with a starting bet of $50 the portfolio value has reached $2000 in around 10-12 days of consistent strategical betting.
